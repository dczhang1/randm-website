# Introduction

The **Calculated and Spontaneous Risk-Taking Scale (CASPRT)** is a 12-item self-report measure designed to assess two distinct styles of risk-taking: *calculated* and *spontaneous*. This manual provides guidance for researchers and practitioners on administering, scoring, and interpreting the CASPRT.

# Theoretical Background

CASPRT is grounded in dual-process theory, which posits two modes of thinking:

- **Calculated Risk-Taking**: Deliberate, analytical, and planned risk-taking after careful consideration of outcomes.
- **Spontaneous Risk-Taking**: Impulsive, emotion-driven, and thrill-seeking risk-taking without extensive deliberation.

Research shows these two styles are related but distinct, predicting different life outcomes and personality profiles.

# Scale Items

The CASPRT consists of 12 items, rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree):

**Calculated Risk-Taking Items:**

1. I tend to take calculated risks in my everyday life.
2. I am willing to take risks after careful consideration of the potential outcomes.
3. I consider myself a calculated risk taker.
4. I believe taking calculated risks is important to achieve your goals.
5. I enjoy taking risks that involve calculation.
6. My friends would consider me as someone that takes calculated risks.

**Spontaneous Risk-Taking Items:**

7. I enjoy the thrill of taking risks without thinking.
8. I am attracted to risky activities where I don't know what will happen.
9. I don't think much about the consequences of risky decisions. I just make them.
10. I find it difficult to resist the urge to take risks.
11. I am a spontaneous risk taker.
12. I often jump into risky situations without thinking through them.

# Administration Instructions

- **Target Population:** Adults and adolescents (research samples include college students, working adults, and general population).
- **Format:** Self-administered questionnaire (paper or electronic).
- **Instructions to Respondents:**
  - "Please rate how well each statement describes you, using the following scale:"
    - 1 = Strongly Disagree
    - 2 = Disagree
    - 3 = Neutral
    - 4 = Agree
    - 5 = Strongly Agree
- **Estimated Completion Time:** 2-3 minutes.

# Scoring and Interpretation

- **Subscale Scores:**
  - *Calculated Risk-Taking*: Mean of items 1-6
  - *Spontaneous Risk-Taking*: Mean of items 7-12
- **Total Score:** Not recommended; interpret subscales separately.
- **Interpretation:**
  - Higher scores indicate greater endorsement of the respective risk-taking style.
  - Example cutoffs (based on population norms):
    - Calculated: High (≥4.0), Moderate (3.0–3.99), Low (<3.0)
    - Spontaneous: High (≥3.0), Moderate (2.0–2.99), Low (<2.0)
- **Percentile Ranks:** See Norms and Percentiles section for interpretation relative to population.

# Psychometric Properties

- **Reliability:**
  - Calculated subscale: Cronbach's α = 0.89; Test-retest (1 week) = 0.83
  - Spontaneous subscale: Cronbach's α = 0.91; Test-retest (1 week) = 0.84
- **Factor Structure:**
  - Two-factor structure confirmed via factor analysis
  - Items load distinctly on calculated and spontaneous factors
- **Measurement Invariance:**
  - Invariant across sex, age, and sample type

# Validity Evidence

- **Convergent Validity:**
  - Both subscales correlate with established risk-taking measures (e.g., DOSPERT, GRiPS)
- **Discriminant Validity:**
  - Calculated risk-taking is associated with conscientiousness, need for cognition, and adaptive outcomes (e.g., creativity, entrepreneurship)
  - Spontaneous risk-taking is associated with impulsivity, lower conscientiousness, and problematic outcomes (e.g., criminal charges, safety violations)
- **Incremental Validity:**
  - CASPRT explains unique variance in life outcomes beyond Big Five personality traits

# Norms and Percentiles

Population norms (N = 1,860):

| Subscale     | Mean | SD  |
|--------------|------|-----|
| Calculated   | 3.34 | 0.85|
| Spontaneous  | 1.93 | 0.91|

Percentile ranks can be calculated using the mean and SD above. Example: a calculated score of 4.0 is approximately the 80th percentile.
