            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>The Risk and Decision Making Lab is dedicated to understanding how individuals and groups navigate the complexities of decision-making under uncertainty. Our interdisciplinary team brings together experts in psychology, neuroscience, and data science.</p>
            <p>We conduct cutting-edge research that bridges theory and practice, tackling questions like: How do people weigh risks in financial investments? What drives group decisions in high-stakes scenarios? How can we better predict human responses to uncertainty?</p>
            <p>Our mission is to advance scientific knowledge and provide insights that inform policy and practice in areas such as health, finance, and environmental sustainability. Join us in unraveling the science of decisions.</p>
