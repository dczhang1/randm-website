                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>The Risk and Decision Making Lab is dedicated to understanding how individuals and groups navigate the complexities of decision-making under uncertainty. Our interdisciplinary team brings together experts in psychology, neuroscience, and data science.</p>
                <p>We conduct cutting-edge research that bridges theory and practice, tackling questions like: How do people weigh risks in financial investments? What drives group decisions in high-stakes scenarios? How can we better predict human responses to uncertainty?</p>
                <p>Our mission is to advance scientific knowledge and provide insights that inform policy and practice in areas such as health, finance, and environmental sustainability. Join us in unraveling the science of decisions.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Jane Smith founded the Risk and Decision Making Lab in 2018 after completing her postdoctoral work at Stanford University. With over 15 years of experience in the field, she has published more than 50 peer-reviewed articles and has been recognized with several prestigious awards for her contributions to decision science.</p>
                        <p>Her research focuses on the intersection of cognitive psychology and behavioral economics, with a particular interest in how emotion influences risk perception. Dr. Smith's work has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and several private foundations.</p>
                        <p>"My goal is to understand the mechanisms behind decision-making so we can help people make better choices in their personal and professional lives. Whether it's financial planning, health decisions, or policy-making, the principles of decision science can guide us toward more rational and beneficial outcomes."</p>
