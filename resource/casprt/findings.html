                        Confirmatory factor analyses showed that a two-factor model with calculated and spontaneous risk-taking as separate but correlated factors provides excellent fit (RMSEA = 0.048; SRMR = 0.049; CFI = 0.981; TLI = 0.976). A bi-factor model also fit well, suggesting items reflect both a general risk factor and specific risk styles.

                    <p>
                        The bi-factor model showed that the general factor accounted for 51% of common variance (ECV = 0.51), demonstrating substantial shared variance between calculated and spontaneous risk-taking, yet the specific factors showed sufficient construct replicability (H = 0.69-0.82) to justify their separate interpretation.

                    <h3>Nomological Network</h3>
                    <p>
                        The CASPRT demonstrated distinct patterns of relationships with personality traits, cognitive styles, and other risk measures, establishing its place in the nomological network of psychological constructs.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Big Five Personality Traits</h4>
                    <div class="chart-container">
                        <canvas id="bigFiveChart"></canvas>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Both risk styles are associated with extraversion, but calculated risk-taking positively correlates with conscientiousness while spontaneous risk-taking negatively correlates with it. This pattern is theoretically consistent, as conscientiousness involves careful planning and deliberation.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Cognitive Traits</h4>
                    <div class="chart-container">
                        <canvas id="cognitiveTraitsChart"></canvas>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Calculated risk-taking is associated with analytical thinking styles (need for cognition, rational decision style, numeracy), while spontaneous risk-taking is associated with intuitive processing and lower analytical thinking. This pattern supports the theoretical foundation of the scale in dual-process theories of thinking.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Established Risk Measures</h4>

                    <p>
                        Both calculated and spontaneous risk styles show strong positive correlations with established risk measures (DOSPERT and GRiPS), confirming that the CASPRT captures core elements of risk propensity while offering additional nuance in distinguishing between different styles of risk-taking.

                    <p>
                        Both risk styles decline with age (r = -.16), but calculated risk-taking shows a slight increase in early adulthood before declining.

                    <p>
                        Men score slightly higher than women on both risk styles, but the effect size is larger for calculated risk-taking (Cohen's d = 0.28 for calculated, d = 0.12 for spontaneous).

                    <h4>Measurement Invariance</h4>
                    <p>
                        The CASPRT demonstrates strong measurement invariance across sex, age groups, and different samples. This indicates that the scale functions similarly across demographic groups, allowing for valid comparisons of scores between different populations.

                    <h3>Risk Attitude Variability</h3>
                    <p>
                        A key finding of our research is that calculated and spontaneous risk-takers differ in how consistently they approach risk across different domains and situations.

                        <h4>Interpretation</h4>
                        <p>
                            Calculated risk-takers show significantly more variability in their risk attitudes across domains and situations, even after controlling for mean risk levels. This suggests they are more discriminating in their risk decisions, considering situational factors rather than applying a uniform approach to all risky situations.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Calculated risk style <strong>positively</strong> predicts cross-domain variability (b = 0.099, p < .001)</li>
                            <li>Spontaneous risk style <strong>negatively</strong> predicts cross-domain variability (b = -0.151, p < .001)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>
                        This pattern aligns with dual-process theories suggesting that calculated risk-takers engage more deliberate processing, allowing them to override automatic preferences based on situational considerations. In contrast, spontaneous risk-takers show more consistency across situations, suggesting their risk decisions are driven more by general tendencies than by domain-specific evaluations.

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Calculated risk-taking</strong> uniquely predicts general health (r = .19, p < .001) and eudaimonic wellbeing (r = .28, p < .001)</li>
                            <li><strong>Spontaneous risk-taking</strong> uniquely predicts criminal charges (r = .27, p < .001), shoplifting (r = .22, p < .001), and traffic tickets (r = .21, p < .001)</li>
                            <li>Both styles predict entrepreneurial intent, but calculated risk-taking is a stronger predictor (r = .39 vs. r = .29)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            These findings suggest that calculated risk-takers are more likely to experience the benefits of risk-taking without the costs, while spontaneous risk-takers experience both benefits and potential negative consequences.

                        <p>
                            Overall, our research suggests that the <em>style</em> of risk-taking—not just the general propensity for risk—is crucial for understanding the relationship between risk-taking and life outcomes.
