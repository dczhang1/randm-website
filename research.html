            <h1>Our Research</h1>
            <p class="research-intro fade-in">The Risk and Decision Making Lab conducts innovative research across several interconnected areas, using diverse methodologies from behavioral experiments to neuroimaging.</p>

                    <h2>Risk Perception</h2>
                    <p>We investigate how people perceive and evaluate risks across different domains, including health, finance, and environmental hazards. Our studies examine factors that influence risk assessment, such as emotion, prior experience, and cultural background.</p>
                    <div class="project">
                        <h3>Featured Project: Cross-Cultural Risk Perception</h3>
                        <p>A multinational study comparing risk attitudes across six countries, revealing how cultural factors shape responses to uncertainty.</p>

                    <h2>Decision-Making Under Uncertainty</h2>
                    <p>Our research explores how individuals and groups make choices when outcomes are uncertain. We examine the cognitive processes, heuristics, and biases that influence decisions in complex environments.</p>
                    <div class="project">
                        <h3>Featured Project: Ambiguity vs. Risk</h3>
                        <p>Experimental studies distinguishing how people respond to known probabilities (risk) versus unknown probabilities (ambiguity) in financial decisions.</p>

                    <h2>Group Decision Dynamics</h2>
                    <p>We study how groups navigate complex decisions, focusing on information sharing, leadership effects, and social influence in collective choice processes.</p>
                    <div class="project">
                        <h3>Featured Project: Emergency Response Teams</h3>

                    <h2>Neural Basis of Decision-Making</h2>
                    <p>Using neuroimaging techniques, we investigate the brain mechanisms underlying different aspects of decision-making, from value computation to risk assessment.</p>
                    <div class="project">
                        <h3>Featured Project: Neural Predictors of Risk-Taking</h3>
                        <p>fMRI study identifying neural markers that predict individual differences in financial risk-taking behavior.</p>
