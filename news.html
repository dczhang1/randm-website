                            <h2>New Publication on Unveiling the Impact of Oddball Interview Questions on Organizational Personality Perceptions</h2>
                            <div class="news-summary">
                                <p>Our study examines how unconventional interview techniques affect job seekers' perceptions of organizations.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="news-details">
                                <p>In a new publication by Don Zhang and RANDM Lab alum John-Luke McCord, we examine oddball interview questions and their influence on organizational personality perceptions. This study sheds light on the impact of unconventional interview techniques on job seekers' perceptions of an organization's personality traits, such as innovativeness and stylistic qualities. The findings offer significant insights for HR professionals, recruiters, and organizational decision-makers aiming to optimize their recruitment processes and create a strong organizational fit.</p>
                                <h3>Key Findings</h3>
                                <p>The study finds that organizations that incorporate oddball interview questions are perceived as more innovative and stylistic by job seekers. This indicates that these unique interview queries have the power to shape the perception of an organization's personality. However, despite positively impacting organizational personality perceptions, oddball interview questions did not significantly enhance job seekers' overall attraction to the organization.</p>
                                <h3>Implications for Recruitment Strategies</h3>
                                <p>The research highlights the need for a balanced approach to interviews, combining both traditional and unconventional questions. While oddball interview questions can contribute to perceptions of an organization's innovativeness and stylistic qualities, they should not be solely relied upon to improve recruitment success.</p>
                                <p>To optimize recruitment strategies, practitioners should consider incorporating a mix of traditional and oddball questions. This approach allows for the assessment of candidates' adaptability, creativity, and cultural fit while taking into account their overall attraction to the organization.</p>

                                <p>In this new paper entitled: "The Bright, Dark, and Grey Sides of Risk Takers at Work: Criterion Validity of Risk Propensity for Contextual Work Performance" - Don Zhang teamed up with Clare Barratt and Rachel Smith to investigate the role of risk propensity on work performance. Although risk takers are typically seen as liabilities, the paper shows that risk takers may be an asset for organization due to their willingness to take risks, which could result in pro-social behaviors that help the organization and its members. However, risk takers were also found to be more deviant in anti-social ways. Thus, risk takers are double-edged swords for organization.</p>

                            <h2>New publication on interviewer overconfidence in the European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology</h2>
                            <div class="news-summary">
                                <p>Research examines interviewer overconfidence and recommends using pre-written interview questions.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="news-details">
                                <p>In this paper with Edgar Kausel, we conducted three lab studies to examine mechanisms and interventions of interviewer overconfidence. We found that interviewers judged their own interview questions as more valid when the same questions were rated by someone else. We also found that putting in more effort increased the perceived validity of the questions but not the question quality.</p>
                                <p>Our findings suggest that letting interviewers write their own questions is not a good idea. They often write poor questions, but also overestimate their validity. Instead, it is best to provide interviewers with high-quality, pre-written questions that they can choose.</p>
