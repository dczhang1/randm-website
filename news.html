We found that interviewers judged their own interview questions as more valid when the same questions were rated by someone else. We also found that putting in more effort increased the *perceived* validity of the questions but not the question quality. Our findings suggest that letting interviewers write their own questions is not a good idea. They often write poor questions, but also overestimate their validity. Instead, it is best to provide interviewers with high-quality, pre-written questions that they can choose.</p>">

Although risk takers are typically seen as liabilities, the paper shows that risk takers may be an asset for organization due to their willingness to take risks, which could result in pro-social behaviors that help the organization and its members. However, risk takers were also found to be more deviant in anti-social ways. Thus, risk takers are double-edged swords for organization.</p>">
