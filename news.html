                    <h2>Dr. Johnson's Research Featured in Scientific American</h2>
                    <p>Lab member Dr. Michael Johnson's groundbreaking work on the neural basis of risk perception was featured in the latest issue of Scientific American. The article highlights how our brain's reward systems influence our willingness to take financial risks and how these insights might inform financial education programs.</p>

                    <h2>New Study Reveals Gender Differences in Financial Risk-Taking</h2>
                    <p>Our recent publication in the Journal of Economic Psychology demonstrates significant differences in how men and women evaluate financial risks. The study, led by Dr. Sophia Chen, suggests that these differences are largely driven by socialization and experience rather than innate preferences.</p>
