# Archive — Deprecated individual pages

The main site is now a **single scrolling page** (`../index.html`). These HTML files are kept for reference and for deep links (e.g. GRiPS, CASPRT, Publications).

- **Nav/footer** on these pages point back to the main site using `../index.html#section` anchors.
- **Asset paths** (CSS, JS, images) use `../` so they load correctly when opened from this folder.

Do not link to these pages from the main site except for:
- `archive/grips.html` — linked from main page “Learn More” for GRiPS
- `archive/casprt.html` — linked from main page “Learn More” for CASPRT  
- `archive/publications.html` — linked from main page footer “Publications”
